The dataset outlines the daily expenses of myself (Brian Ofosu). It can
be categorized as a structured data since the data has been presented in
an organized, row-column format, enabling any individual to draw
conclusions on my allocation of funds in a week. During the recording
and cleaning process, I noticed that there might be blanks for certain
days, more specifically the non-working days, where fund allocation is
different from that of the working days. The following data can help in
budgeting, since it allows one to understand their daily necessities and
expenses and how to efficiently allocate their available resources. The
structure of data can determine how fast meaningful information can be
drawn from a dataset. For instance, in this project, I learnt that
organization of data helps paint a clearer picture of one’s activities
and/or events, hence make meaningful adjustments where necessary in
order to solve a problem. Let’s take for instance the dataset obtained
from this project. Since I know how I spend my money on daily basis, if
I wanted to save purchase something I need, I know how to adjust my
expenses so as to maximize savings.
